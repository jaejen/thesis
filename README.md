# Jennifer Lee Senior Thesis Code 

This repository contains most of the code used for this senior thesis project, including but not limited to the data processing and general analysis.

In the IRA directory, you can find the code used to do a topical analysis of Internet Research Agency trolls from October 22, 2016 to November 2, 2016, in general_analysis.ipynb. In the russia_hashtags.ipynb, this code was used to simple scrape the most popular hashtags among the IRA trolls.

In the raw_filtered directory, you can find an almost identical python notebook in generaly_analysis.ipynb, except pertaining to the genuine Twitter users within the aforementioned time frame. The analysis for engagement and influence is contained in hashtag_analysis.ipynb and retweet_analysis.ipynb. 

Given the volume of the code, if there is a specific area of the code that you would like clarified for its function, please reach out to me by email.
